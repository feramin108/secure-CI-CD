# Secure-CI-CD
This project involves setting up a secure CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins, integrated with OWASP tools like Dependency-Check and ZAP. The aim is to automate security checks throughout the development and deployment process.

**Step 1:**
Create a Namespace for Jenkins. It is good to categorize all the devops tools as a separate namespace from other applications.
